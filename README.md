# monkey-lang
Interpreter and compiler for the monkey lang written in Go.

Monkey lang is the language featured in Thorsten Ball's books: 
[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) & [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/)

This repository is a presentation of my work as I go throughout both books.

Below is a list of links to my thoughts as I go throughout the books.
