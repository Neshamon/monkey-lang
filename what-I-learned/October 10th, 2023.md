# Lexers

  One of the more interesting things I noticed about today as I learned about
was when I encountered the fact that my lexer couldn't recognize the integer 5
when running all of my test cases.

  I felt that though I have been programming for a while now, I simply didn't
recognize that the test case could fail. And when I continued to read through
Thorsten's book about how to resolve the issue, it became clear to me that
the things that computers are capable of whether it's mathematical operations
or something as simple as writing a plain text document; It's all dependent
on the rules that the programmer defines with their code.

  Honestly such a thing doesn't sound very profound, and I may have already
known that from my experience with interacting with code. But it became
much more obvious to me in that moment because I had always thought computers
were good with dealing with numbers, yet here I was in that moment and my
Lexer couldn't recognize the number 5 as an integer. Why?
Because I had not shown the computer how to interpret that data type yet
within my lexer.

  Overall, I found it interesting because all the things that I take for
granted in standard libraries or all the optimizations that are made for me
in language compilers, these things aren't as rock solid as I had
thought them to be; All programs are subject to the best efforts of an
engineer to solve a problem. And that solution may or may not be the most
effective. Under the right circumstances 2 + 2 can always equal 5 in a given
language.

  And this urges me to think about what the essence of a computer
really is. All my life I've been told that they're simply very fancy calculators
but this simple issue with my lexer shows otherwise. Computers are only
good at math because of the engineers who made them to be good at math.
They are only good with graphics because those who optimized them to be
good with graphics. For better or worse computers are more or less mirrors
to the capacity of a given engineer; They are extremely malleable in
ways both beneficial and disadvantageous.

  What is a computer's true essence? I still can't say but I hope to find out
more as I learn.
